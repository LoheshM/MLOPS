## **Project 1: End-to-End MLOps Pipeline for Predicting Student Math Scores**

### Overview  
An automated pipeline to predict student math scores using various regression models, including Random Forest and XGBoost, with Linear Regression achieving the best performance (R² = 0.88).  

### Key Features  
- **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis):** Identified significant factors like lunch type and parental education affecting math scores.  
- **Model Training:** Tested multiple models to determine the best fit for accurate predictions.  
- **MLOps:** Built a robust pipeline including preprocessing, model training, and deployment.  
- **CI/CD Integration:** Automated deployment using pipelines.  
- **AWS Deployment:** Deployed on AWS infrastructure for scalability and accessibility.  

### Tools & Technologies  
- **MLFlow Tracking:** For experiment tracking and logging.  
- **Apache Airflow DAGs:** For workflow orchestration.  
- **DagsHub Integration:** For collaborative version control and tracking.  
- **AWS Services:** For deployment.
